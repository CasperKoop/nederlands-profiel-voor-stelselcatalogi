|Voorkeursterm|Ordered collection

|Voorkeursterm|Controlled vocabulary
|Definitie|A controlled vocabulary is a carefully selected list of words and phrases, which are used to tag units of information (document or work) so that they may be more easily retrieved by a search.
|Toelichting|Controlled vocabularies provide a way to organize knowledge for subsequent retrieval. They are used in subject indexing schemes,subject headings,thesauri,taxonomies and other knowledge organization systems. Controlled vocabulary schemes mandate the use of predefined,authorised terms that have been preselected by the designers of the schemes,in contrast to natural language vocabularies,which have no such restriction.

|Voorkeursterm|definition
|Definitie|SKOS: A statement or formal explanation of the meaning of a concept. ISO11179: Representation of a concept by a descriptive statement which serves to differentiate it from related concepts.

|Voorkeursterm|has close match
|Definitie|skos:closeMatch is used to link two concepts that are sufficiently similar that they can be used interchangeably in some information retrieval applications. In order to avoid the possibility of "compound errors" when combining mappings across more than two concept schemes, skos:closeMatch is not declared to be a transitive property.

|Voorkeursterm|broader term (generic)

|----------|------
|Voorkeursterm|concept
|Definitie|Concepts are the units  of thought —ideas, meanings, or (categories of) objects and events— which underlie many knowledge organization systems.
|Toelichting|The prime application for a thesaurus is in information retrieval, where the aim is to search for concepts. Concepts are represented by terms. Each term included in a thesaurus should represent a single concept (or unit of thought). Concepts can range from the simple (e.g. cats) to the very complex (e.g. racial discrimination among ethnic minorities). Compound terms or phrases are generally needed to express the more complex concepts.

|Toelichting|A taxonomy is be used to organize and index knowledge (stored as documents, articles, videos, etc.), such as in the form of a library classification system, or a search engine taxonomy, so that users can more easily find the information they are searching for. Taxonomies are hierarchies (and thus, have an intrinsic tree structure).

|----------|------
|Voorkeursterm|term
|Definitie|Word or phrase used to label a concept.
|Toelichting|A concept has a human-readable label (including spaces and diacritics). This is equal to the skos: prefLabel. An exception to this is the situation that within one concept scheme the same skos:prefLabel is used more than once. This is not a good practice and should be avoided as much as possible. In case this occurs nonetheless, the rdfs: label gets an addition between brackets that indicates the distinction. This label can be multilingual, indicated by @nl or @en


|topbegrip<div style="width:325px"></div>||

|voorkeursterm<div style="width:325px"></div>||
|----------|------
|Voorkeursterm|preferred label
|Definitie|The preferred lexical label for a resource, in a given language.
|Toelichting|The terms selected to represent concepts may be single-word terms or multi-word terms. In ordinary discourse, a single term might have more than one meaning, and the most common meaning is not always the one needed to represent the concept wanted in the thesaurus. If the context provided by the hierarchy of broader and narrower concepts linked to the concept in question is insufficient to elucidate the intended scope, additional measures should be applied. While all thesaurus terms should be expressed as unambiguously as possible, it is especially important to formulate the preferred term of a given concept in such a way that it conveys the intended scope to any user. For example, the multi-meaning term "depression" could be reformulated as "economic depression" or "meteorological depression", as appropriate. Alternatively a qualifier may be used. In cases where these measures are not appropriate or sufficient, or where additional information would help to clarify the meaning and make the usage more consistent, an explicit scope note should be used.


|bron<div style="width:325px"></div>||
|----------|------
|Voorkeursterm|source
